# OOP-Game-Show-App
 
Created a browser-based word guessing game. Utilized Javascript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard. 

Code selects a random phrase, splits the phrase into letters, and puts those letters onto the game board.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the game board displays the chosen letters on the screen.
